script to install on vps

openvpn-install

OpenVPN road warrior installer for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.
Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

wget https://git.io/vpn -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that

You can get a VPS from just $1/month at VirMach.
