OpenVPN road warrior installer for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.
Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

#**OPENVPN INSTALL**#

<code>wget https://git.io/JEBcT -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh</code>

#**Squid squid3.5 INSTALL**#

<code>wget https://git.io/JEBrP -O Squid3-install.sh && bash Squid3-install.sh</code>

#**CENTOS 7 NSTALL**#

<code>wget https://git.io/JEBrP -O Squid3-install.sh && bash Squid3-install.sh</code>

<code>yum -y update && yum -y install wget && wget https://git.io/JERmn && chmod +x Centos7 && ./Centos7 && rm -f Centos7 && history -c</code

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
I want to run my own VPN but don't have a server for that

You can get a VPS from just $1/month at VirMach.
